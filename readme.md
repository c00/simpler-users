# Simpler users

This is supposed to be a starting point for adding a user system to your projects. And with 'your' I mean 'mine' because it's based on c00/common which is my query builder for MySQL.

If you're reading this, you should really be asking yourself why, as this is not a functional product yet, hardly even an alpha. So, go do something useful with your time, please!
